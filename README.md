### File transfer <br>

This program transfers files between two paths and maintains record using a mongodb. This program is useful if you are constantly accumulating data in some external device E.g: a smartphone and the memory is limited. So, instead of waiting to transfer the files manually, you can use this program to free space as the device retrieves more data. Plus, you don't have to actually deal with the device's routines and everything is done from the remote device that accumulates everything.  

It is like Dropbox, but does not sync data or maintains copies in several locations. It centralizes the data while giving more free space to limited memory devices.
